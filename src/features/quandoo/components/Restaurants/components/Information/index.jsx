                in Singapore to whet your appetite. The various cuisines of the
                world are well-represented in all parts of the island, so
                whether you crave scrumptious French pastries in the morning, a
                healthy but indulgent lunch of sushi and sashimi, or a late
                supper of dim sum, you’re sure to stumble upon a restaurant in
                Singapore that provides exactly what you’re looking for. Even

                a chance to experience their world-class fine dining chops.

                Featuring a blend of influences from Malay, Chinese, Indian,
                Peranakan and western cuisines – to name a few – Singaporean
                cuisine is diverse, and that has a lot to do with its history as
                a port city with a large immigrant population. No visit to
                Singapore is complete without sampling dishes like Hainanese
                chicken rice, laksa and chilli crab – and these are just a small
                fraction of the highlights one can expect to find at restaurants
                in Singapore that specialise in the local fare. For some of the
                most authentic homegrown flavours, Wok Master in Farrer Park
                does tze char right, though Uncle Chicken (Sin Kee Famous
                Chicken Rice) in Tiong Bahru is where you should be heading to
                for steaming plates of Singapore’s highly-acclaimed national
                dish. Both Singaporean restaurants are bookable on Quandoo,
                which makes it easy for you to secure tables even during busy
                periods.

                Regardless of your dietary preferences and limitations, you’ll
                find that they’re well taken care of across the restaurants in
                Singapore. A significant local Muslim and Hindu population means
                that a plethora of halal as well as pork-, beef- or even
                meat-free dining establishments are well within reach. My Spice
                Affair in Kallang is a must-visit for home-cooked halal Malay
                cuisine, especially for its famous nasi ambeng. While those in
                favour of a wholesome, plant-based meal should check out Xing
                Hua Vegetarian Restaurant in Bugis, which dishes out the goods
                without preservatives, MSG or additives. Last but not least,
                there’s also Annalakshmi Restaurant in Clarke Quay, known for
                its delicious Indian vegetarian buffet with a unique
                pay-what-you-want concept.

                Searching for a place to drink more than to eat? Singapore has
                numerous cafes and bars for that. For many executives based in
                the CBD, mornings may begin with a quick cuppa at Candour
                Coffee, while cafes like Suzette offer a respite in the middle
                of a harried work day by the scenic Esplanade waterfront – with
                a delectable array of desserts to boot. Come sundown, CBD
                watering holes like Bar on Chulia and Beer Xchange fill up with
                the afterwork crowd, eager to unwind with an evening tipple,
                while Idle at International Business Park remains the location
                of choice for those based outside of town thanks to its six-hour
                long liquid buffet. Whether you need a table at a bar, cafe or
                restaurant in Singapore, avoid disappointment by booking online
                with Quandoo. It’s that easy!
